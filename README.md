            <h2>Their Friendship</h2>
            <p>
                Muhammad Ali and Pelé shared a unique bond that transcended their respective sports—boxing and soccer—and extended into the realms of social and civil rights movements. Both athletes were not only icons in their fields but also influential figures who used their platforms to advocate for change <button class="citation-flag" data-index="9">.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their friendship was marked by mutual respect and admiration. Pelé, widely regarded as the greatest soccer player of all time, and Ali, known as "The Greatest" in boxing, recognized each other's greatness in their disciplines. In 1977, Ali attended what would be Pelé's farewell game with the New York Cosmos, where they exchanged a kiss on the cheek, symbolizing their close friendship <button class="citation-flag" data-index="8">.

                Beyond their athletic prowess, both men broke barriers through sport. Pelé worked extensively with the UN as a goodwill ambassador from 1992, using his status to promote various causes <button class="citation-flag" data-index="9">. Ali, on the other hand, was renowned for his public stance against the Vietnam War and his advocacy for racial equality, making him a symbol of resistance and empowerment <button class="citation-flag" data-index="3">.

                Muhammad Ali was not just a boxer but also a social activist who fought racism and state violence in the context of a formal democracy <button class="citation-flag" data-index="2">. Pelé, while facing criticism for not speaking up against racism, was seen as a hero by many who shared his background and inspired countless individuals through his achievements <button class="citation-flag" data-index="6">.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both men came from deprived upbringings and rose to become global icons, using their fame to influence societal change. Their legacies continue to inspire generations of athletes and activists alike <button class="citation-flag" data-index="10">.
